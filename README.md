# fuzziac.js
Fuzziac.js is JavaScript class for on-line approximate string matching. It was originally intended for use with auto-complete, such as that provided by jQuery UI. This is started as a research project for an undergraduate algorithms class which I took way back in 2011. We had to complete a term project on an algorithm, and Dr. Duan made dynamic programming look cool, so I though I would look for an application of dynamic programming outside the realm of DNA sequencing.

If you would like to know the full story on how I came to develop this solution you can read the post I wrote about the [history of fuzziac.js][fuzziacpost], or you can read my [original research paper][fuzziacresearch].
